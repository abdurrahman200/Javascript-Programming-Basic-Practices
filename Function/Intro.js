/* what is Function = 
 Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.*/
// input ,output , processing 
// important think who is created a function and who call it 2 part = create, call

function add() {
    var a = 1
    var b = 2
    console.log(a+b)
}
function sub() {
    var a = 1
    var b = 2
    console.log(a+b)
}
